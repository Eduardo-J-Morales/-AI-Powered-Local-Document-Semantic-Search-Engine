# Real-time Markdown previewer and editor

This project is a desktop utility designed to help users organize their local documents, including PDFs and text files. It leverages AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically extract keywords and suggest relevant tags from document content. A C# API manages document metadata and user-defined tags, provides endpoints for document upload, searching, and tag management, and interacts with a Python component for the AI tasks. The Python part uses NLP libraries like scikit-learn or spaCy for keyword extraction and tag suggestions, storing all metadata and AI-suggested tags in a local SQLite database. The frontend, a vanilla JavaScript interface, allows users to upload documents, view organized lists, search by tags or keywords, manage AI-suggested tags, and preview documents. The C# API serves the static frontend files, making it a self-contained local application.
